# pythonEM. 

Personal (attempts at) python scripts which others might find useful. <br/><br/>

Predominantly (exclusively?) cryoSPARC pertaining scripts due to the nature of their metadata files.<br/>

I do not really 'know' python. I just keep changing things until the intended output is achieved. <br/>
